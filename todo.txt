opening lines to add:

1) the `new line' in the Max Lange

1.5) playing white with the ..d5 Bd5 Qd5 Nc3 trick

2) the two knights with 4.d3

3) the active reply to the Petroff

4) the Grunfeld, video by video

5) 4. 0-0 against the two knights defence - including Boden-Kieseritsky transposition.

development:

grouping of openings into folders

removal of the rep module - there are some issues with pickling;
try to identify which repertoires where pickled when the rep module was pickled
(i.e. by placing them outside the Repertoires/ folder temporarily)
and devise a method of retaining the training data while cleaning the references to the rep module
